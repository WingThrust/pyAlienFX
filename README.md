It intend to be easily upgradable for future updates of the AlienFX device, as it happened for the M11XR3. And, to be a powerfull GTK apps, that can be linked with plugins throught a deamon server, allowing the LED to be controled accordingly !  Any Help is more than welcome ! Especially testing on different computers !
